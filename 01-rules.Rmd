# Ten simple rules {#rules}

### Context {-}  
Rules help. Individually, simple rules can support [emotional regulation](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fcap0000142) and belief. [Ten simple rules can be a magic number in science](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006670), and this format of paper has been an incredibly successful medium for best practices and sharing expertise. Make, use, plan, and use data were the most common themes in the first 100 papers  of work in using this heuristic model published in PLOS Computational Biology. [Ten simple rules for more objective decision-making](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007706) is a compelling and relevant examplar that supports structured decision making for screen time use. Break into smaller parts, mitigate bias, be transparent, and beware cognitive dissonance. These are salient principles for screen time decisions. Here, rules are proposed specific to screen time use using [principles for simple rules](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003858) including have ten, have a vision, and support with research as needed.  

**Rules**  

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
rules <- read_csv("./rules.csv")
knitr::kable(rules, booktabs = TRUE)

```



### Learning outcomes {-}  
1. Explore the behavioral trait reshaping capacity of life-hacking rules.      
2. Examine some of the key evidence that supports your screen adaptation theory and personal development.       
3. Change how you use screens.    

### Challenge time {-}  
1. Review the ten simple rules. Experiment was one per day/week for a few days/weeks. Small changes first. Track its efficacy.  
2. Develop and test a cognitive energy budget, daily. [Here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Cognitive_energy_budgets/19735525) is an example of a tracking exercise data dive for a scientist. 
3. List any rules you were using for screen time (implicit or explicit).  


### Reflection questions {-}  
1. Document the extent that the rules improved your performance.  
2. Do you have different screen time rules for your team or family than you currently adopt or would consider adopting?  
3. Was there a place or time that screen time work was best supported for a specific work or professional task?
