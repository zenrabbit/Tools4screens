Ten simple rules can be a magic number in science, and this format of paper has been an incredibly successful medium for best practices and sharing expertise. Make, use, plan, and use data were the most common themes in the first 100 papers of work in using this heuristic model published in PLOS Computational Biology. Ten simple rules for more objective decision-making is a compelling and relevant examplar that supports structured decision making for screen time use. Break into smaller parts, mitigate bias, be transparent, and beware cognitive dissonance. These are salient principles for screen time decisions. Here, rules are proposed specific to screen time use using principles for simple rules including have ten, have a vision, and support with research as needed.

Challenge your own absurdity and drives. Develop a nature identity that includes active engagement with an outdoor pursuit or place. Challenge time Review this slide deck and attend discussion. Read ‘The Little Prince’ short tale. Read ‘The Little Prince is an ecologist’ comment paper. Test your creativity using this short test. Reflect on your scores and the radial plot and how connectedness can enhance some of the measures. Reflection questions Interactions are fundamental to all living organisms. To what extent does interaction theory, very broadly speaking, inform the ecology of your life? Do you have an outdoor identity? If you could change this view, what would you innovate or augment for this self-vision? Even one mountain climbed makes you a climber. Or one bird spotted and identified a small step to becoming a birder. Are there some of the nature hacks proposed (or new alternatives you envision) that can be used to restore, recharge, or rev up your creative performance and cognitive clarity?
